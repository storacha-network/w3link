## Building

Want to help us improve w3s.link? Great! This project uses node v16 and pnpm. It's a monorepo that use workspaces to handle resolving dependencies between the local `packages/*` folders.

Copy the <.env.tpl> file to `.env` and install the deps with `pnpm`.

```console
# install deps
pnpm install
```
