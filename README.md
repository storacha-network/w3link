## Usage

Get your files from the IPFS Network via their unique content identifier with a lightning fast experience. Like any other IPFS gateway, `w3s.link` supports IPFS path style resolutions `https://w3s.link/ipfs/{cid}` and subdomain style resolution `https://{CID}.ipfs.w3s.link/{optional path to resource}`

```
> curl https://w3s.link/ipfs/bafkreig5ry6hjrkj2xyut5yrdjztap2z2yso6qlq4n7rnalt5l4lsccw2u
Hello web3.storage! ðŸ˜Ž
